# FAMILY_ID - Unique identifier for each family using the app
# 
# HOW IT WORKS WITH MULTIPLE FAMILIES (App Store Scenario):
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 
# The current app uses AsyncStorage (local device storage), which means each
# device/user already has isolated data - no FAMILY_ID is needed for local-only use.
#
# However, if you want family members to share data across devices, you would:
#
# Option A: Dynamic Family ID (Recommended for App Store)
#   - Each family creates their own unique ID when they first set up the app
#   - The FAMILY_ID is NOT hardcoded in .env but generated/stored locally
#   - Family members join by entering/scanning the family's ID
#   - Data is stored with FAMILY_ID as a prefix in a cloud database
#   Example: Each family gets a UUID like "fam_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
#
# Option B: Backend-Generated Family ID
#   - When a user creates an account, the backend generates a family
#   - Other family members join via invite code/link
#   - FAMILY_ID is stored in user's profile, not in .env
#
# IMPORTANT: For App Store deployment, you should NOT use a static .env FAMILY_ID
# because all app users would share the same family! Instead, implement one of
# the dynamic options above.
#
# For local development/testing only:
FAMILY_ID=dev-family-001
